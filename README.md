# anes_muslim
My hypothesis for this project is to see if Increased endorsement of nativist definitions of
citizenship will be associated with decreased Muslim favorability. I knew I could not just
measure nativist beliefs in this project which is why there are other factors that need to
be taken into account. I was hoping to see correlation with how much people follow
politics, party affiliation, race, and levels of education. The reason why I chose this topic
was due to the Islamophobic legislation under the Trump Administration. I saw unusual
bias in banning and treating those with islamic or middle eastern heritage “worse” than
those not of that background. Since the ANES data only had data before 2020 I still
want to see how muslims have been perceived in the past and how highly rated it was.
After running my t-tests and looking at the data, I found many major findings. My
hypothesis was proven correct, as invariant of race and education status, muslims were
perceived as less favorable by those who identified as more republican and/or more
nativist/more american. This was shown in both the t-test values as well as the scatter
plots covering nativist beliefs with Muslim favorability. 3 level boxplots expressed stark
differences in party affiliation as well. Proving my statement that, endorsement of
nativist definitions of citizenship is strongly related to Muslim evaluations, but
differences in this relationship due to education status are weak.
